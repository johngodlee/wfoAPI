# wfoAPI

An R package to use the World Flora Online GraphQL API to search for taxonomic names and their synonyms.

Unlike the [WorldFlora](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WorldFlora/index.html) R package, this package does not require the user to download a static copy of the World Flora Online database.
